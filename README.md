Time 2 train is a workout app I have created that currently runs on expo.
It allows users to create a login with email and password.
Users can create their own profile with their own personal stats and profile picture.
Time 2 Train allows users to create new workouts and save them to the database so that they can view them later on to track progress. Users also have access to a 1 rep max calculator in which they can input the data for one of their sets to calculate their max.
